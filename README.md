WAVtoMIDI takes in a .wav file and converts it to a .mid file. It accomplishes this by performing FFT's on a single channel (the left-most) of the audio data at user specified time steps. It then separates the resulting frequency analysis into equivalence classes which correspond to the twelve tone scale; the volume of each class being the average volume of its constituent frequencies. It then formats this data for midi and writes it out to a user specified file. It is written in Python with Qt4. Although, I am also working on porting it to the D programming language
